  <h1>Design Patterns in a Nutshell</h1>
</div>

Welcome to the **Design Patterns in a Nutshell** repository! This repository is a companion to the handbook _Design Patterns in a Nutshell_ and is designed to provide practical, runnable examples for each pattern discussed. Whether you're a beginner or a seasoned developer, you'll find this resource invaluable for mastering design patterns.

## üìÇ Repository Structure

The repository is neatly organized into three main folders, corresponding to the **three families** of design patterns. Each pattern links directly to its folder and example:

### **1. Creational Patterns** [(`/Creational Patterns`)](./Creational%20Patterns)
Focus on object creation mechanisms, increasing flexibility and reuse:
- [Singleton](./Creational%20Patterns/singleton)
- [Factory Method](./Creational%20Patterns/factory-method)
- [Abstract Factory](./Creational%20Patterns/abstract-factory)
- [Builder](./Creational%20Patterns/builder)
- [Prototype](./Creational%20Patterns/prototype)
- [Object Pool](./Creational%20Patterns/object-pool)

### **2. Structural Patterns** [(`/Structural Patterns`)](./Structural%20Patterns)
Deal with the composition of classes and objects to form larger structures:
- [Adapter](./Structural%20Patterns/adapter)
- [Proxy](./Structural%20Patterns/proxy)
- [Decorator](./Structural%20Patterns/decorator)
- [Flyweight](./Structural%20Patterns/flyweight)
- [Composite](./Structural%20Patterns/composite)
- [Bridge](./Structural%20Patterns/bridge)
- [Fa√ßade](./Structural%20Patterns/facade)

### **3. Behavioral Patterns** [(`/Behavioral Patterns`)](./Behavioral%20Patterns)
Concerned with algorithms and object interaction:
- [Template Method](./Behavioral%20Patterns/template-method)
- [Observer](./Behavioral%20Patterns/observer)
- [State](./Behavioral%20Patterns/state)
- [Command](./Behavioral%20Patterns/command)
- [Mediator](./Behavioral%20Patterns/mediator)
- [Visitor](./Behavioral%20Patterns/visitor)
- [Strategy](./Behavioral%20Patterns/strategy)
- [Chain of Responsibility](./Behavioral%20Patterns/chain-of-responsibility)
- [Iterator](./Behavioral%20Patterns/iterator)
- [Memento](./Behavioral%20Patterns/memento)
